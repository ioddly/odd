Odd

Odd is a Scheme-derived programming language. 

Short version:

- Scheme semantics
- Helpful expressions
- Sugary syntax that translates to symbolic expressions in a pretty obvious way
- Hygienic macros and modules
- Incremental garbage collection
- Fast, direct dispatching virtual machine
- Extremely easy to redistribute (can be distilled to a single C++ header)
