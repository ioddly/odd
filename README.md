Odd is a Scheme-derived programming language. 

Make sure to run 'git submodule update --init' after cloning.

Short version:

- Scheme semantics
- Helpful error messages
- Sugary syntax that translates to symbolic expressions in a pretty obvious way
- Hygienic macros and modules
- Incremental garbage collection
- Fast, direct dispatching virtual machine
- Extremely easy to redistribute (can be distilled to a single C++ header)

For more information, see the [Odd manual](http://ioddly.com/projects/odd/).
